# Business Problem & Solution

## The Challenge

Modern e-commerce platforms face several challenges when analyzing product performance:

1. **High Volume Data Processing**
   - Millions of user interactions (views, clicks, purchases) per minute
   - Need to process events in real-time
   - Must handle traffic spikes during peak periods

2. **Real-Time Insights**
   - Immediate visibility into product performance
   - Quick detection of trending products
   - Rapid response to inventory changes

3. **Complex Metrics**
   - Tracking unique users across sessions
   - Calculating accurate conversion rates
   - Analyzing time-based trends

4. **Data Consistency**
   - Maintaining accurate statistics across distributed systems
   - Handling out-of-order events
   - Ensuring exactly-once processing

## Real-World Example

Consider a typical e-commerce scenario with "Premium Headphones":

### Input Data Sources

```json
// 1. Product Events (high volume, real-time)
{
    "productId": "P123",
    "userId": "U789",
    "eventType": "VIEW",
    "timestamp": 1648656000000,
    "value": 199.99
}

// 2. Product Metadata (low volume, updated periodically)
{
    "productId": "P123",
    "name": "Premium Headphones",
    "category": "Electronics",
    "basePrice": 199.99
}
```

### Business Insights Generated

```json
// Real-time Analytics Output
{
    "productId": "P123",
    "name": "Premium Headphones",
    "category": "Electronics",
    "viewCount": 145,
    "uniqueUsers": 89,
    "totalValue": 1799.91,
    "conversionRate": 0.12,
    "windowStart": 1648656000000,
    "windowEnd": 1648656300000
}
```
